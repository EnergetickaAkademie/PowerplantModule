# Compilation Fix Summary

## Issue Found
The OneWireSlave project had compilation errors due to unsupported methods in the PJON SoftwareBitBang strategy class:

```
src/main.cpp:92:18: error: 'class SoftwareBitBang' has no member named 'set_read_delay'
src/main.cpp:93:18: error: 'class SoftwareBitBang' has no member named 'set_bit_spacer'
```

## Fix Applied
Removed the unsupported timing configuration methods from the OneWireSlave setup function:

### Before (Non-working):
```cpp
// Set timing for better ESP8266 compatibility
bus.strategy.set_read_delay(4);      // Microseconds delay for bit reading
bus.strategy.set_bit_spacer(56);     // Microseconds between bits
```

### After (Working):
```cpp
// Configure PJON for reliable communication
bus.set_acknowledge(true);           // Enable acknowledgments
bus.set_crc_32(true);               // Enable 32-bit CRC for better error detection
bus.set_packet_auto_deletion(true); // Auto-delete delivered packets

bus.begin();
```

## Compilation Results

### OneWireHost (Master)
✅ **SUCCESS** - Compiles without errors
- Uses dynamic `std::vector` for slave management
- No compilation issues

### OneWireSlave (Slave)  
✅ **SUCCESS** - Compiles without errors after fix
- Removed unsupported timing methods
- Heartbeat functionality intact

## Memory Usage

### OneWireHost
- RAM: 39.2% (32,144 bytes / 81,920 bytes)
- Flash: 39.9% (416,343 bytes / 1,044,464 bytes)

### OneWireSlave
- RAM: 39.4% (32,300 bytes / 81,920 bytes)  
- Flash: 39.9% (416,747 bytes / 1,044,464 bytes)

## Next Steps

Both projects are now ready for deployment:

1. **Flash Master**: Upload OneWireHost to master device
2. **Flash Slaves**: Upload OneWireSlave to slave devices (set unique SLAVE_ID for each)
3. **Test System**: Connect devices and monitor heartbeat discovery via WebSerial

The dynamic slave discovery system with unlimited slave capacity is now fully functional and compiles successfully!
