# Debug Handler and PJON Broadcast Implementation - COMPLETED

## Task Summary
Successfully implemented the debug receive handler functionality and PJON broadcast support for the com-prot library as requested.

## Completed Features

### 1. Debug Receive Handler
✅ **Added DebugReceiveHandler typedef**
- Function signature: `void(uint8_t* payload, uint16_t length, uint8_t senderId, uint8_t messageType)`
- Available for both ComProtMaster and ComProtSlave classes

✅ **Added Debug Handler Methods**
- `setDebugReceiveHandler(DebugReceiveHandler handler)` - Set debug handler
- `removeDebugReceiveHandler()` - Remove debug handler
- Implemented for both master and slave classes

✅ **Debug Handler Integration**
- Master: Debug handler called on every received message in `handleMessage()`
- Slave: Debug handler called on every received message in `handleMessage()`
- Handler is called BEFORE message processing, allowing full visibility

### 2. PJON Broadcast Support
✅ **Updated Master's sendCommandToSlaveType**
- Now uses `bus->send_packet(PJON_BROADCAST, ...)` for type-based commands
- Message format: `[COM_PROT_COMMAND, slaveType, command, ...data]`
- Only sends broadcast if slaves of target type are connected

✅ **Updated Master's sendCommandToSlaveId**
- Message format: `[COM_PROT_COMMAND, 0, command, ...data]` (0 = unicast)
- Maintains compatibility with existing unicast messages

✅ **Updated Slave Message Handling**
- Slaves now check message format: `[messageType, targetType, command, ...data]`
- Process message if `targetType == 0` (unicast) OR `targetType == slaveType` (broadcast)
- Backward compatible with existing implementations

### 3. Code Integration
✅ **Updated Examples**
- `master_example.cpp`: Added debug handler demonstration
- `slave_example.cpp`: Added debug handler demonstration
- Both examples show proper usage of new features

✅ **Updated Main Projects**
- `OneWireHost/src/main.cpp`: Added debug handler with smart heartbeat filtering
- `OneWireSlave/src/main.cpp`: Added debug handler with rate limiting
- Both projects ready to use new broadcast functionality

✅ **Updated Documentation**
- README.md updated with new features and API documentation
- Examples showing debug handler usage
- Explanation of broadcast vs unicast message formats

### 4. Repository Updates
✅ **Git Repository**
- All changes committed to https://github.com/EnergetickaAkademie/com-prot.git
- Changes pushed to main branch (commit: 941b08e)
- Both OneWireHost and OneWireSlave already use this repository as dependency

## Implementation Details

### Message Formats
- **Heartbeat**: `[0x03, slave_id, slave_type]` (unchanged)
- **Broadcast Command**: `[0x04, slave_type, command, data...]`
- **Unicast Command**: `[0x04, 0x00, command, data...]`

### Debug Handler Features
- Called on EVERY received message (heartbeats, commands, responses)
- Provides full message visibility for debugging
- Can be enabled/disabled at runtime
- Examples include smart filtering to reduce log spam

### PJON Broadcast Benefits
- More efficient than individual unicast messages
- Proper PJON collision detection and retry logic
- Slaves automatically filter messages by type
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Testing
- Library compiles successfully
- Examples demonstrate all new features
- Integration with existing OneWireHost/OneWireSlave projects complete
- Ready for deployment and testing with actual hardware

## Next Steps
1. Deploy updated code to actual ESP8266 devices
2. Test broadcast functionality with multiple slaves of same type
3. Monitor debug output to verify proper operation
4. Optionally add more sophisticated debug filtering if needed

All requested features have been successfully implemented and are ready for use!
